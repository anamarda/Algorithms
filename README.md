This is a repository in which I learn and deepen my knowledge about Data Structures and Algorithms. 

The folders are as follows:

1. Dynamic Programming
This folder has the problems as a results of a Dynamic Programming course from YouTube (maybe the best DP course - and it is free!). Totally worth it.
It is from freeCodeCamp.org: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBt53YbR9Kk
Each problem has 3 solutions: brute force, memoization and tabulation. 

2. Graph Algorithms
Graph Theory revision.

3. Heap data structure
